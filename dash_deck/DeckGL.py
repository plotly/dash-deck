class DeckGL(Component):
    """A DeckGL component.
This component lets you visualizes PyDeck and deck/json files
directly in Dash. It also exposes various events (such as click,
hover and drag) inside callbacks.

Keyword arguments:

- id (string; optional):
    The ID used to identify this component in Dash callbacks.

- clickEvent (dict; optional):
    Read-only prop. To use this, make sure that `enableEvents` is set
    to `True`, or that `enableEvents` is a list that contains this
    event type. This prop is updated when an element in the map is
    clicked. This contains the original gesture event (in JSON).

- clickInfo (dict; optional):
    Read-only prop. To use this, make sure that `enableEvents` is set
    to `True`, or that `enableEvents` is a list that contains this
    event type. This prop is updated when an element in the map is
    clicked. This contains the picking info describing the object
    being clicked. Complete description here:
    https://deck.gl/docs/developer-guide/interactivity#the-picking-info-object.

- data (dict | string; optional):
    Your map using the Deck.gl JSON format. This can be generated by
    calling `pdk.Deck(...).to_json()`. Both a Python dictionary and a
    JSON-string your map is accepted.

    to `True`, or that `enableEvents` is a list that contains this
    event type. This prop is updated when the user releases from

    Read-only prop. To use this, make sure that `enableEvents` is set
    to `True`, or that `enableEvents` is a list that contains this
    event type. To use this, make sure that `enableEvents` is set to
    `True`, or that `enableEvents` is a list that contains this event
    type.  This prop is updated when the user starts dragging on the

- dragStartInfo (dict; optional):
    Read-only prop. To use this, make sure that `enableEvents` is set

- enableEvents (list of strings | boolean; default False):
    Either a boolean indicating if all event callbacks should be
    enabled, or a list of strings indicating which ones should be
    used. If it's a list, you will need to specify one of the
    following gestures: `click`, `dragStart`, `dragEnd`, `hover`.

- hoverEvent (dict; optional):
    Read-only prop. To use this, make sure that `enableEvents` is set
    to `True`, or that `enableEvents` is a list that contains this
    event type. This prop is updated when an element in the map is
    hovered. This contains the original gesture event (in JSON).

    You will need a mapbox token to use deck.gl. Please create a
    mapbox and follow the instructions here:
    https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/.
